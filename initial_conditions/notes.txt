Simulation 1:
Input WUS,CK, Ratio of iso/anisotrpic growth by L1,L2, depth of deeper layers
Model assumptions:
Growth rate = f(WUS)
Growth direction loaded from eric's data
Division plane as function of WUS/CK concentration 
(Don't expect this to work)

Simulation 2 (Mech. hypothesis)
Input WUS,CK, Ratio of iso/anisotrpic growth by L1,L2, depth of deeper layers
Model assumptions:
Growth rate = f(WUS)
Growth direction loaded from eric's data
Division plane as function of tensile stress
(Want this to work)

Simulation 3 (Chem growth vs Mech Division)
Input: WUS distribution, CK distribution
Model assumptions:
Growth rate function of WUS
Growth direction based on WUS/CK concentration
Division plane function of tensile stress.


Uncertainty quantification (???)
Help with simulations (???)
