NDEL
For these I tried to make it so that node delete was only checked for cells that had
a recent_div marker on them (As in mother daughter recent div variable,
around for 2 VTK frames)
Result:  This was a disaster. Walls were less stable than ever, eventually ending in a NAN using 
small_cluster initial conditions.

NDEL2
In addition to the changes for NDEL*, these had a flag built into Cell::delete_Wall_Node_Check()
so that Tissue::delete_Wall() would run Tissue::update_Adhesion(); whenever nodes were deleted.
(This is probably a bad idea. Don't push this, but just see what happens.)
Result:  These results were ruined by the original NDEL changes and discarded. Retrying after
rolling back the NDEL change.
*Result (Without NDEL change):
